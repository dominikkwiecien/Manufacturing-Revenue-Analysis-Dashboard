# Manufacturing Revenue Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project features a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that provides detailed insights into the revenue dynamics of a manufacturing company. The dashboard was developed as part of an advanced data analysis exercise, emphasizing the use of Level of Detail (LOD) expressions, table calculations, and cohort analysis to deliver actionable insights on revenue trends, customer acquisition, and retention.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were:

1. **Practice LOD Expressions**: Utilize Level of Detail (LOD) calculations to create accurate, granular reports on revenue.
2. **Implement Table Calculations**: Apply table calculations to analyze trends and percentage changes in revenue.
3. **Build an Interactive Dashboard**: Develop a user-friendly dashboard that integrates multiple revenue-related analyses, offering dynamic filtering options for deeper exploration.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project originates from a hypothetical manufacturing company. It includes detailed revenue data, customer purchase history, and geographic information, enabling a robust analysis of the company's revenue streams.

## Dashboard Overview

The final Tableau dashboard integrates six key visualizations that collectively offer a holistic view of the company's revenue performance:

1. **Total Monthly Cash Inflow**:

   - Line chart depicting the total revenue amount collected each month, highlighting trends and fluctuations in cash inflows.
